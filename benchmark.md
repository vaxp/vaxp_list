# vaxp List Algorithms Benchmark üöÄ

This document provides performance benchmarks for the algorithms included in the **vaxp_list** library. The goal is to offer clear, transparent data on how each algorithm performs on various data sizes.

## How to Run the Benchmark üßë‚Äçüíª

Any developer can replicate these results on their own machine to verify performance.

1. **Clone the Repository**Bash
    
    `git clone https://github.com/vaxp/vaxp_list.git`
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**Bash
    
    `cd vaxp_list`
    
3. **Run the Benchmark Script**
The project includes a dedicated script to test all algorithms. Run the following command from the project's root directory:Bash
    
    `dart run .benchmark/benchmark.dart`
    

The script will run tests on lists of 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 elements and print the results to the console.

### **Analysis of Results**

The results clearly demonstrate the practical impact of algorithmic complexity (Big O notation).

- **O(n¬≤)** algorithms like `Bubble Sort` and `Cycle Sort` show a dramatic decrease in performance as the input size grows by a factor of 10.
- **O(n log n)** algorithms like `Comb Sort` maintain excellent performance, showcasing their suitability for larger datasets.
- **O(n)** algorithms remain extremely fast across the board.
